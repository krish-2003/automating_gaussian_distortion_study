## automating_gaussian_distortion_study

These codes are useful to reduce the manual work while using the Gaussian calculations. 
kisc.py and kisc_calc.py are used to calculate the kisc rate from the singlet-triplet energies and the SOC value. 
kisc.py is for individual transitions, while kisc_calc.py calculates the rate for all transitions.
